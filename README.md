## Why?
Because creating a legal page sucks.

## How?
With this repo you can host your legal page in just 3 steps.

### 1. Fork this repository
https://github.com/vincenzourbisaglia/legalpage_template   
![](https://legalpage.org/images/baseline_info_black_18dp.png) Make sure your repository is public. 

### 2. Verify ownership of your domain
Every legalpage is bound to a domain.   
To verify that you own your domain create a TXT record that points to your legal page repository.
